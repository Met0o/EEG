# EEG
Repo containing python code for EEG data processing and analysis.

In order to open the notebooks, you'll need to have a python environment installed on your computer. I do recommend using Anaconda for this.

You can download and install Anaconda for Windows from here: 
- https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

Once you have Anaconda set, you can configure your python environment.

Either create a new environment and install your packages inside it, or use the default environment that Anaconda has created for you. I recommend the first option.

Open up Anaconda Navigator from your start menu and start Jupyter Notebook.
This will open up Jupyter in your web browser or you may get a popup asking you how to open the HTML file - choose your default browser.

When Jupyter opens, you will see a list of folders. Choose a folder of your liking (Documents for instance) and create a new folder there to paste the notebook and the "data" folder from the repo.

Navigate to your new folder and open the notebook, and make sure you have the data directory in the folder where the jupyter notebook is.
